# Grape Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting diseases in grape leaves using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of grape leaves into healthy or various disease categories, helping farmers and agriculturists to identify and manage plant diseases effectively.

## 📌 Features

- Accurate classification of grape leaf diseases using CNN.
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.
- Training and evaluation scripts included.
- User-friendly interface for testing images.
- Visualization of results and model performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Download [leafdisease.ipynb](leafdisease.ipynb)
2. Download the dataset
3. To test the model on new images:upload in [Google colab](https://share.google/mG3y0iMbwwJcKkltk)
4. upload the dataset in google drive
5. Mount the google drive
6. Run the cells one by one
